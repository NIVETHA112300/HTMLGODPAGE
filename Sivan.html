    In the Shaivite tradition, Shiva is the Supreme Lord who creates, protects and transforms the universe.[17][18][19] In the goddess-oriented Shakta tradition, the Supreme Goddess (Devi) is regarded as the energy and creative power (Shakti) and the equal complementary partner of Shiva.[23][24] Shiva is one of the five equivalent deities in Panchayatana puja of the Smarta tradition of Hinduism.[25] Shiva is known as The Destroyer within the Trimurti, the Hindu trinity which also includes Brahma and Vishnu.[6][26]
